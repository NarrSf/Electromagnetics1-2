For my Electromagnetism I project, I studied a paper on the human discharge chain and wrote a summary in my own words based on what I understood. I also developed a simulation code that models a chain of RC circuits related to the paper.

For my Electromagnetism II project, I tried to derive Maxwell’s equations using quantum-mechanical operators, based on two papers and Feynman’s derivation approach. I also wrote a simulation code for a magnetic dipole and an electric monopole fields.
